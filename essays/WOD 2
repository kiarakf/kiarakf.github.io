WOD2
Compared to BrowserHistory1, BrowserHistory2 was more of a struggle for me. I attempted to do the WOD without help from the screencast but was having a very hard time following the steps. The first objective that i struggled with was linking the style.css to my index.html. When I reached this part, I had to go to the screencast to give me some guidance. Once I was able to figure it out, I paused the screencast and attempted to finish the rest of the objectives. Creating the rules within the style sheet was not that difficult for me, especially with all the helpful tips that VS Code gives us along the way. However,  a strange thing that I was experiencing was that my updates weren’t being seen as I refreshed my browser. I’m not sure why, but when I went to the file from my local computer and opened it (not refreshing the same one from WOD1), I could see the updates there. 

After doing this WOD I found a way of completing the tasks that works for me. I do what I can on my first attempt, then reference back to the screencast when I am confused on what to do. By doing this, I know I am going to get a DNF. I just continue to go back and forth and get to the final result. Once I get to the final result, I delete my code and start up to get a better time. I had to attempt this WOD multiple times in order to get a time that I was satisfied with. However, I didnt have to reference the screencast during my final trys. I was familiar with what I was doing, just needed to become more efficient.
