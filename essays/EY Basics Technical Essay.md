BROWSER HISTORY 1

Fall of 2018 I had to take ICS101, like many of us had to, which introduced me to the ICS390 class, which I took the following semester in Spring 2019. A crucial part of the ICS390 class was being a TA for a current ICS101 course. This gave me the opportunity to become very familiar with the basic coding skills that we used in the BrowserHistory1 workout. I was able to go through the entire WOD, play around and re-familiarize myself with some of the tools, and also realized the links we were given to study for the first quiz was extremely helpful. Slowly but surely, I was able to complete the first workout without looking at the screen cast. I knew there was probably a more efficient way to complete the WOD, so after receiving a Sd for my first attempt, I watched the screen cast, realized some new tricks, and deleted my initial code, and tried it again. The second time I was able to complete the WOD in 14 minutes!

My advice for this WOD would be to try the first attempt without any help. This will give you a good understanding of what you know and what you need to learn, re-teach, and brush up on. I don’t recommend looking at the screencast prior to your first attempt because it won’t be helpful for your future. It is ok to need to refresh your memory and re-teach yourself some tricks so don’t be afraid to fail your first attempt! 


BROWSER HISTORY 2

Compared to BrowserHistory1, BrowserHistory2 was more of a struggle for me. I attempted to do the WOD without help from the screencast but was having a very hard time following the steps. The first objective that i struggled with was linking the style.css to my index.html. When I reached this part, I had to go to the screencast to give me some guidance. Once I was able to figure it out, I paused the screencast and attempted to finish the rest of the objectives. Creating the rules within the style sheet was not that difficult for me, especially with all the helpful tips that VS Code gives us along the way. However,  a strange thing that I was experiencing was that my updates weren’t being seen as I refreshed my browser. I’m not sure why, but when I went to the file from my local computer and opened it (not refreshing the same one from WOD1), I could see the updates there. 

After doing this WOD I found a way of completing the tasks that works for me. I do what I can on my first attempt, then reference back to the screencast when I am confused on what to do. By doing this, I know I am going to get a DNF. I just continue to go back and forth and get to the final result. Once I get to the final result, I delete my code and start up to get a better time. I had to attempt this WOD multiple times in order to get a time that I was satisfied with. However, I didnt have to reference the screencast during my final trys. I was familiar with what I was doing, just needed to become more efficient.
