Hello Everyone!
I hope this essay format works correctly! I am brand new to coding and have been having quite a hard time doing this E0 Assignment. As you know by now, my name is Kiara Fairbairn and I am currently a junior majoring in MIS at UH Manoa. I was born and raised in Kailua, Hawaii and graduated from Punahou Schools. I became interested in MIS through my sister-in-law who was a computer science major. She currently codes for JP Morgan in Houston Texas and absolutely loves it. We are very similar so she encouraged me to take the MIS route. 

A few facts about me is that I love sports and the beach! I grew up playing competitive soccer and actually attended American University my Freshmen year of college playing Division I Soccer. I decided to transfer home and my first year and ended up back at home! I am very happy I did and have enjoyed my time here at UH. Excited for the new semester and everything we are going to learn in this class!
