Fall of 2018 I had to take ICS101, like many of us had to, which introduced me to the ICS390 class, which I took the following semester in Spring 2019. A crucial part of the ICS390 class was being a TA for a current ICS101 course. This gave me the opportunity to become very familiar with the basic coding skills that we used in the BrowserHistory1 workout. I was able to go through the entire WOD, play around and re-familiarize myself with some of the tools, and also realized the links we were given to study for the first quiz was extremely helpful. Slowly but surely, I was able to complete the first workout without looking at the screen cast. I knew there was probably a more efficient way to complete the WOD, so after receiving a Sd for my first attempt, I watched the screen cast, realized some new tricks, and deleted my initial code, and tried it again. The second time I was able to complete the WOD in 14 minutes!

My advice for this WOD would be to try the first attempt without any help. This will give you a good understanding of what you know and what you need to learn, re-teach, and brush up on. I don’t recommend looking at the screencast prior to your first attempt because it won’t be helpful for your future. It is ok to need to refresh your memory and re-teach yourself some tricks so don’t be afraid to fail your first attempt!
